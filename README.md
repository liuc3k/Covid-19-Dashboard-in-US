# Covid-19-Dashboard-in-US

## Introduction

A R-shiny application for users not only to track Covid-19 cases/deaths in the US map or certain states but also acquire related demographic plots/tables interactively.

## Summary

*  This <b>R-shiny</b> application focuses on producing a chronograph map and a time series plot to visualize monkeypox/orthopoxvirus cases in the United States (US) as a web application, developed using the <b>Shiny</b> and <b>Leaflet</b> library in R.

*  Three small boxes on the top of the dashboard display real-time cases information such as, "Total Confirmed Cases", "Daily Cases", and "Last Update", respectively. 

*  An interactive US <b>chronograph map</b> to display confirmed cases in each state. The map can either display confirmed cases for each state by zooming in with scroller or obtain aggregated confirmed cases by zooming out with scroller.

*  Provides a <b>time series bar plot</b> for users to observe the confirmed cases change in a metric over time as a series of bars.
